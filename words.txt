Overfit
    Learning a function that fits the training data very well but does not generalise to other data points.

Bias-variance
    The bias-variance tradeoff also relates to model generalization. In any model, there is a balance between bias, which is
    the constant error term, and variance, which is the amount by which the error may vary between different training sets.
    So, high bias and low variance would be a model that is consistently wrong 20% of the time, whereas a low bias and high
    variance model would be a model that can be wrong anywhere from 5%-50% of the time, depending on the data used to train
    it.

    Supervised learning
        Training a model given input values with their respective output values. Learn a function that best approximates
        the relationship between input and output observable in the data.

    Unsupervised learning
        Does not have labeled outputs. The goal is to infer the natural structure present within a set of data points.

Normalisation
    Transforming features to use a similar scale.

    Larger numbers are considered more important(?). If feature A has a range 1-10 and feature B has range 100-1000 then
    feature B may be given more importance due to its larger values. Normalisation puts both feature A and B on the same
    scale.

Backpropagation
    ?

Model
    A statistical representation of a prediction task. You train a model on examples then use the model to make predictions.

    Sequential model
        A linear stack of layers.

    Functional model
        Layers can connect to more than just the previous the next layer. Layers can be connected to any other layer.

Layer
    Dense layer
        Topology. Describes how the neurons are connected to the next layer of neurons (every neuron is connected to every
        neuron in the next layer). A fully connected layer. A linear operation in which every input is connected to every
        output by a weight.
