Normalisation
    Transforming features to use a similar scale.

    Larger numbers are considered more important(?). If feature A has a range 1-10 and feature B has range 100-1000 then feature B may
    be given more importance due to its larger values. Normalisation puts both feature A and B on the same scale.

Model
    A statistical representation of a prediction task. You train a model on examples then use the model to make predictions.

    Sequential model
        A linear stack of layers.

    Functional model
        Layers can connect to more than just the previous the next layer. Layers can be connected to any other layer.

Layer
    Dense layer
        Topology. Describes how the neurons are connected to the next layer of neurons (every neuron is connected to every neuron in
        the next layer). A fully connected layer. A linear operation in which every input is connected to every output by a weight.
